 abstract = {Copyright Â© The Author(s), 2020. Introduction During pregnancy, the imperative to stop smoking becomes urgent due to health risks for mother and baby. Aim Explore responses to a smoking-related, pregnancy-focused Risk Behaviour Diagnosis (RBD) Scale over time with Aboriginal1 pregnant women. Methods Six Aboriginal Medical Services in three states recruited 22 eligible women: 1/228 weeks' gestation, 3/416 years old, smoked tobacco, pregnant with an Aboriginal baby. Surveys were completed at baseline (n = 22), 4-weeks (n = 16) and 12-weeks (n = 17). RBD Scale outcome measures included: perceived threat (susceptibility and severity), perceived efficacy (response and self-efficacy), fear control (avoidance), danger control (intentions to quit) and protection responses (protecting babies). Results At baseline, the total mean threat scores at 4.2 (95% CI: 3.9-4.4) were higher than total mean efficacy scores at 3.9 (95% CI: 3.6-4.1). Over time there was a non-significant reduction in total mean threat and efficacy; fear control increased; danger control and protection responses remained stable. Reduction of threat and efficacy perceptions, with raised fear control responses, may indicate a blunting effect (a coping style which involves avoidance of risks). Conclusion In 22 Aboriginal pregnant women, risk perception changed over time. A larger study is warranted to understand how Aboriginal women perceive smoking risks as the pregnancy progresses so that health messages are delivered accordingly.},
