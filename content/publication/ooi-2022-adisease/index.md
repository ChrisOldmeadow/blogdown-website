abstract = "This review aimed to investigate national estimates of sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption in children and adolescents aged two to 18 years, from countries in regions particularly burdened by dietary-related chronic illnesses. The most recent studies or reports from included countries (n = 73) with national-level consumption data of SSBs in children and adolescents, collected between January 2010 and October 2019, were considered for inclusion. A random effects meta-analysis was used to calculate pooled estimates of the mean consumption of SSB in millimeters per day. Heterogeneity between national estimates was assessed using the I2 statistic and explored via subgroup analyses by the World Health Organization region, age groups, and country-level income. Forty-eight studies were included in the review reporting national estimates of consumption for 51 countries. The highest estimate of daily consumption was in China at 710.0 mL (95% confidence interval (CI) [698.8, 721.2], while the lowest was in Australia at 115.1 mL (95% CI [111.2, 119.1]). Pooled synthesis of daily SSB consumption of the 51 countries was 326.0 mL (95% CI [288.3, 363.8]), although heterogeneity was high, and was not explained by subgroup analyses. While there is considerable variability between countries, intake of SSB remains high among children and adolescents internationally underscoring the need for public health efforts to reduce SSBs consumption."
