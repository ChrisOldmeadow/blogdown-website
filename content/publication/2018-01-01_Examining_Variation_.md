abstract = "Purpose: The majority of research on psychological outcomes for cancer patients has focussed on the role of individual characteristics, and disease and treatment factors. There has been very little exploration of the potential contribution of the treatment clinic to these outcomes. This study explored whether there is variation among clinics in cancer patients’ psychological outcomes. Methods: Cancer outpatients were recruited from 22 medical oncology and haematology clinics in Australia. Participants completed a pen and paper survey including the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), as well as sociodemographic, disease and treatment characteristics. Results: Of those eligible to participate, 4233 (82%) consented and 2811 (81% of consenters) returned the completed survey. There was no statistically significant variation in HADS depression scores across clinics. Some difference in anxiety scores derived from the HADS questionnaire between clinics (p = 0.03) was found with the percentage of between-clinic variation estimated to be 1.11%. However, once all demographic, disease and treatment predictors were adjusted for there was no statistical differences between clinics (percent of between-clinic variation = 0.53%; p = 0.1415). Conclusions: Psychological outcomes were not found to vary between clinics. Other sources of variation including patient characteristics may over-ride between-clinic variability, if it exists."
