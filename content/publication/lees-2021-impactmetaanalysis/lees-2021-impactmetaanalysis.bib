 abstract = {Introduction Disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) are the mainstay of treatment for relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS). There is established evidence that DMTs are effective at reducing relapse rate and disease progression in RRMS, but there has been less consideration to the synthesis of MRI and neurocognitive outcomes, which play an increasingly important role in treatment decisions. The aim of this systematic review and network meta-analysis is to examine the relative efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of DMTs for RRMS, using MRI and neurocognitive outcomes. Methods and analysis We will search electronic databases, including MEDLINE, Embase and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, with no date restrictions. We will also search the websites of international regulatory bodies for pharmaceuticals and international trial registries. We will include parallel group randomised controlled trials of DMTs including interferon beta-1a intramuscular, interferon beta-1a subcutaneous, interferon beta-1b, peginterferon beta-1a, glatiramer acetate, natalizumab, ocrelizumab, alemtuzumab, dimethyl fumarate, teriflunomide, fingolimod, cladribine, ozanimod, mitoxantrone and rituximab, either head-to-head or against placebo in adults with RRMS. Primary outcomes include efficacy (MRI outcomes including new T1/hypointense lesions and T2/hyperintense lesions) and acceptability (all-cause dropouts). Secondary outcomes include gadolinium-enhancing lesions, cerebral atrophy and tolerability (dropouts due to adverse events). Neurocognitive measures across three domains including processing speed, working memory and verbal learning will be included as exploratory outcomes. Data will be analysed using a random-effects pairwise meta-analysis and a Bayesian hierarchical random effects network meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy, acceptability and tolerability of the included DMTs. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses will be conducted to assess the robustness of the findings. The review will be reported using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews incorporating Network Meta-Analyses statement. Ethics and dissemination This protocol does not require ethics approval. Results will be disseminated in a peer-reviewed academic journal. PROSPERO registration number CRD42021239630.},
