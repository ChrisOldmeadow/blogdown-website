 abstract = {This study examined the prevalence of and sociodemographic characteristics associated with elevated symptoms of depression among clients seeking alcohol or other drug (AOD) treatment. Consenting clients attending two AOD outpatient clinics answered demographics, treatment questions and the Patient Health Questionnaire to assess depressive symptoms. Counts and percentages were calculated to determine the prevalence of elevated depressive symptoms. Logistic regression was used to model the odds of having elevated depressive symptoms for client demographics. Of the 203 clients who completed the survey (87% consent rate), 55% (n = 111) demonstrated elevated depressive symptoms. Females were twice as likely to experience elevated symptoms of depression compared to males (OR 2.07; 95% CI 1.05, 4.08; P = 0.037). The high rates of elevated depressive symptoms among individuals seeking AOD treatment highlight the importance of ongoing research to provide effective treatments for this comorbidity. Routine screening and clear treatment pathways may assist with providing high quality care.},
