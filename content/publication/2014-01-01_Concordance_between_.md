abstract = "There are a growing number of large cohorts of older persons with genome-wide genotyping data available, but APOE is not included in any of the common microarray platforms. We compared directly measured APOE genotypes with those imputed using microarray data and the {"}1000 Genomes{"} dataset in a sample of 320 Caucasians. We find 90% agreement for ε2/ε3/ε4 genotypes and 93% agreement for predicting ε4 status, yielding kappa values of 0.81 and 0.84, respectively. More stringent thresholds around allele number estimates can increase this agreement to 90-97% and kappas of 0.90-0.93."
