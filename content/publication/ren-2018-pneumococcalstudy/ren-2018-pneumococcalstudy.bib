 abstract = {Background: The pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (PPV) has been associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular events in human observational studies. Animal studies suggest that the phosphorylcholine epitope in the Streptococcus pneumoniae cell wall is structurally similar to oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), hence PPV induces the production of antibodies that cross-react with anti-oxLDL and may cause regression of atherosclerotic plaque. We set out to determine the strength of association between PPV administration and reduction in cardiovascular events. Methods: A longitudinal, population-based cohort study of older Australians, from the Hunter Community Study, with up to 11 years of follow-up. We included participants aged ≥ 65 years at baseline (2004–2008), without a history of cardiovascular disease (CVD). History of PPV administration at baseline was the main exposure of interest. “Total number of hospital bed-days with CVD primary diagnosis” was one of the main outcomes measured. Models were adjusted for age, diabetes, alcohol intake, and smoking status. Influenza vaccine was the control exposure used and fracture bed-days was the control outcome used, to investigate the potential for residual confounding. Results: 91 of the total 1074 participants (mean age = 72, male = 45%) experienced a CVD event during follow-up. PPV (regardless of influenza vaccine) was associated with a significant reduction in CVD bed-day, (n = 863, incident rate ratio, IRR = 0.65, 95%CI: 0.45–0.94, p = 0.02), but influenza vaccine (regardless of PPV) was not (n = 864, IRR = 0.86, 95%CI: 0.54–1.35, p = 0.51). Furthermore, PPV adjusted for influenza vaccine remained associated with CVD bed-days (IRR = 0.64, 95%CI: 0.43–0.96, p = 0.03) but was not associated with fracture bed-days (IRR = 0.75, 95%CI: 0.28–2.00, p = 0.56). Conclusion: PPV demonstrated a 35% reduction in CVD bed-days. This finding was robust to residual confounding, using a control exposure and a control outcome, eliminating the concern for healthy-user bias. A large double-blinded placebo-controlled RCT is underway to confirm our finding and to explore the proposed mechanism of action (ACTRN12615000536561).},
