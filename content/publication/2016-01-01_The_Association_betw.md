abstract = "This study aimed to (i) describe concurrent and simultaneous tobacco and cannabis use and (ii) investigate the association between cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco in a sample of socioeconomically disadvantaged smokers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted in 2013 and 2014 with current tobacco smokers receiving aid fromtwo community service organizations in New South Wales, Australia. At least weekly cannabis use for the month prior to survey, motivation to quit tobacco and intentions to quit tobacco were measured in 369 participants (77% consent rate). Regressions were carried out to investigate associations between weekly cannabis use and motivation and intentions to quit tobacco. Concurrent tobacco and cannabis use was reported by 19% (n=71) of the sample and of these users, 100% reported simultaneous use. Although regular cannabis use was significantly associated with lower motivation to quit tobacco, it was not significantly associated with intentions to quit tobacco in the next 30 days. Concurrent cannabis use is common in disadvantaged smokers andmay play a role in decreasedmotivation to quit tobacco; however, it does not appear to be associated with intentions to quit in a sample of disadvantaged smokers."
