 abstract = {Background: Stroke survivors sit for long periods each day. Uninterrupted sitting is associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Breaking up uninterrupted sitting with frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity has an immediate positive effect on blood pressure and plasma clotting factors in healthy, overweight, and type 2 diabetic populations. Aim: We examined the effect of frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity on blood pressure and plasma fibrinogen in stroke survivors. Methods: Prespecified secondary analyses from a three-armed randomized, within-participant, crossover trial. Participants were 19 stroke survivors (nine female, aged 68 years old, 90% able to walk independently). The experimental conditions were sitting for 8 h uninterrupted, sitting with 3 min bouts of light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min, or sitting with 3 min of walking every 30 min. Blood pressure was measured every 30 min over 8 h and plasma fibrinogen at the beginning, middle, and end of each day. Intention-to-treat analyses were performed using linear mixed models including fixed effects for condition, period, and order, and a random intercept for participant to account for repeated measures and missing data. Results: Sitting with 3 min bouts of light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 3.5 mmHg (95% CI 1.7–5.4) compared with sitting for 8 h uninterrupted. For participants not taking antihypertensive medications, sitting with 3 min of walking every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 5.0 mmHg (95% CI −7.9 to 2.0) and sitting with 3 min bouts light-intensity exercise while standing every 30 min decreased systolic blood pressure by 4.2 mmHg (95% CI −7.2 to −1.3) compared with sitting for 8 h uninterrupted. There was no effect of condition on diastolic blood pressure (p = 0.45) or plasma fibrinogen levels (p = 0.91). Conclusion: Frequent, short bouts of light-intensity physical activity decreases systolic blood pressure in stroke survivors. However, before translation into clinical practice, the optimal duration and timing of physical activity bouts needs to be determined.
