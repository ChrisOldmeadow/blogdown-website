 abstract = {Introduction The apprenticeship model of general practice (GP) training is based on appropriate supervision. A central component of supervision in-consultation information-seeking of GP trainees from their trainer has not been documented. We aimed to establish the prevalence, characteristics and associations (trainee, practice, patient and consultation) of this information-seeking. Methods Australian trainees recorded demographic, clinical and educational details of 60 consecutive consultations in each GP term of their training, including the rate and nature of information-seeking. Results Six-hundred and forty-five trainees contributed data for 1426 trainee-rounds, 84 723 consultations and 131 583 problems. Information was sought from the trainer for 9130 (6.9% (95% CI 6.87.1)) of all problems encountered (and in 7833 (9.2% (95% CI 9.09.4)) of consultations): 11.7% (95% CI 11.0 12.4) were for diagnosis, 53.1% (95% CI 52.154.2) for management and 35.2% (95% CI 34.236.2) for both diagnosis and management. Assistance was sought most commonly for skin problems (20.0%) and musculoskeletal problems (12.6%). Significant adjusted associations of informationseeking included patient age; male patient gender; earlier training term; trainee being younger and female; trainee's training organisation; longer consultation; and trainee generation of learning goals. Discussion Our findings have implications for trainer workload and professional development, patient care and trainee education and training.},
