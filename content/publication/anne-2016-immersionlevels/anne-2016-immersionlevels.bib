 abstract = {Elevations in postmortem vitreous sodium chloride (PMVSC) levels may help in differentiating saltwater/seawater drowning (SWD) deaths from immersion deaths not related to drowning (DNRD). It is unclear whether the elevation is related to blood/plasma electrolyte changes after inhalation of seawater as hypothesized in SWDs or possibly caused by electrolyte diffusion and/or osmosis across the outer coats of the eyeball during immersion. Aim: To investigate the changes in bovine PMVSC levels at different time points while immersed in seawater. Methods: Bovine eyeballs were obtained from an abattoir and randomized into 2 groups: A) submerged in seawater ("wet" group) or b) placed in an impermeable plastic bag that was immersed in seawater ("dry" group). The PMVSC levels from 6 eyeballs were measured from each group (without replacement) at 30 minutes, 1 hour, 6 hours, and 12 hours. Results: There was no significant difference in mean PMVSC levels between the 2 groups at 30-minute and 1-hour intervals. A significant difference was noted from 6 hours onward. Discussion: There is no statistically significant elevation in bovine PMVSC levels when immersed in seawater for up to 1 hour. Assuming similar physical properties in humans, any elevations in PMVSC levels in bodies immersed in seawater for less than 1 hour should not be caused by immersion.},
