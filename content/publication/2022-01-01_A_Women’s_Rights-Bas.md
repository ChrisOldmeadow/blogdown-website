abstract = "Objectives: Mother’s health and wellbeing significantly affects child health. Women’s autonomy can improve healthcare-seeking behaviour, utilisation of healthcare services, and planned pregnancy, thereby improving child health. The global under-five mortality rate (U5MR) has seen the fastest decline in the past two decades, but the influence of gender equality on child mortality remains unaddressed. A strategic approach addressing gender equality is needed to reduce the U5MR further. The study aimed to identify and investigate the association between indicators of gender equality and U5MR using a human rights-based approach. Methods: We analysed open-source secondary data from international agencies comprising 521 gender-sensitive variables for 193 countries. Nine variables were included for the final Structural Equation Model based on the theoretical model. Model 1 consisted of 193 countries, and Model 2 comprised a subgroup analysis of 11 variables for 158 countries. Gender equality was a latent variable, and the U5MR was the outcome variable. Results: Gender equality was significantly associated with U5MR (Z = − 7.47, 95% CI = − 754.67 to − 440.98, p {$<$} 0‧001, n = 193 for Model 1, and Z = − 7.71, 95% CI = − 808.26 to − 480.72, p {$<$} 0‧001, n = 158 for Model 2). Female education, women’s waged and salaried employment, women as employers, and women’s representation in leadership and parliament enhanced gender equality, whereas the prevalence of child marriage and intimate partner violence (IPV) negatively affected gender equality. Improvement in gender equality significantly reduced U5MR. Conclusions for practice: Improving women’s economic, educational, and social position and increasing female representation in higher leadership and policymaking positions is the key to reducing child mortality. Notably, eliminating child marriage and IPV is the key to achieving gender equality and is needed at the forefront of national policies. Gender equality can significantly improve women’s reproductive autonomy, a critical factor in improving healthcare utilisation for women and their children."
