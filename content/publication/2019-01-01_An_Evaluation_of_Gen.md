abstract = "National and international guidelines recommend opportunistic screening for chronic kidney disease to allow for early detection and management. Despite these guidelines, screening for chronic kidney disease in general practice settings is often suboptimal. This paper reports the results of a study that evaluated: (a) the effect of an asynchronous web-based e-learning module on general practice nurses' knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practices and (b) general practice nurses' perceived satisfaction with the e-learning module. Changes in chronic kidney disease knowledge were assessed using a pre-test and post-test evaluative design, and satisfaction scores were measured on completion of the module. Participants' baseline knowledge scores were poor, with mean pre-test scores of 3.77 (s.d. 1.66) out of 10. Post-test scores revealed a significant improvement (mean difference 1.81, (95% CI: 1.53-2.09), P {$<$} 0.01) however, overall final scores remained inadequate. Participants highly rated their satisfaction with the design of the module. Our results suggest that an asynchronous web-based e-learning module can improve general practice nurses' knowledge about chronic kidney disease risk factors and screening practice. Efforts are required to increase practice nurses' access to educational opportunities designed to improve knowledge in this area with the aim of increasing opportunistic screening for chronic kidney disease in the general practice setting."
