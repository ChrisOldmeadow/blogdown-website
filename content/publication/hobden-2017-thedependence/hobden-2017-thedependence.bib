 abstract = {Copyright © 2017 by the Research Society on Alcoholism Background: The Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) is commonly used to examine depressive symptoms in clinical settings, including facilities treating patients for alcohol addiction. No studies have examined the validity of the MADRS compared to an established clinical diagnostic tool of depression in this population. This study aimed to examine the following: (i) the validity of the MADRS compared to a clinical diagnosis of a depressive disorder (using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV-TR [SCID-IV-TR]) in patients seeking treatment for alcohol dependence (AD); (ii) whether the validity of the MADRS differs by type of SCID-IV-TR-based diagnosis of depression; and (iii) which items contribute to the optimal predictive model of the MADRS compared to a SCID-IV-TR diagnosis of a depressive disorder. Methods: Individuals seeking treatment for AD and admitted to an inpatient unit were administered the MADRS at day 2 of their detoxification program. Clinical diagnoses of AD and depression were made via the SCID-IV-TR at the beginning of treatment. Results: In total, 803 participants were included in the study. The MADRS demonstrated low overall accuracy relative to the clinical diagnosis of depression with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.68. The optimal threshold for balancing sensitivity and specificity identified by the Euclidean distance was  > 14. This cut-point demonstrated a sensitivity of 66%, a specificity of 60%, a positive predictive value of 50%, and a negative predictive value of 75%. The MADRS performed slightly better for major depressive disorders compared to alcohol-induced depression. Items related to lassitude, concentration, and appetite slightly decreased the accuracy of the MADRS. Conclusions: The MADRS does not appear to be an appropriate substitute for a diagnostic tool among alcohol-dependent patients. The MADRS may, however, still be a useful screening tool assuming careful consideration of cut-points.},
