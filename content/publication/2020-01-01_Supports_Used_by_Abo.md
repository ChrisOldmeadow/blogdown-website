This study explored Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women’s use of supports for their general health, for smoking cessation, and the health of babies or children, and analyzed the women’s predictors for seeking types of support. Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women were recruited for a cross-sectional survey in two regions of NSW N = 132. The 19-item survey questioned the likelihood that the participant would use the various supports for their health, to quit smoking, and for a baby or child’s health. Logistic regression analyses were performed on N = 98 with complete data. Older participants were less likely to use Facebook or the internet for their health, or the health of a child, but were more likely to consult with health professionals. Women who had quit smoking were less likely to use an app for their health compared to smokers. Women who had a child living in their household were less likely to use the internet for a child’s health. This community-based study revealed age-related differences for access to health services and differences according to smoking status. Patterns of internet and app use warrant further consideration when planning strategies to improve Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander women and children’s health."
