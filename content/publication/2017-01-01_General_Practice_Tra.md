abstract = "Background/Objectives: Skin conditions are commonly encountered in general practice but dermatology is underrepresented in undergraduate medical courses. Australian and international studies have shown that the dermatological diagnostic ability of general practitioners (GPs) is suboptimal, contributing to increased dermatology outpatient referrals. Dermatological experience in GP vocational training is thus of particular importance. We aimed to document the prevalence of skin disease presentations and the range of skin diseases encountered by GP trainees. We also sought to establish associations of GP trainee's skin disease experience, including their personal characteristics, consultation factors, and the actions arising from the consultation. Methods: This study took place in the Registrars Clinical Encounters in Training (ReCEnT) study. ReCEnT is an ongoing, prospective, multi-site cohort study of Australian GP trainees' consultations. A descriptive cross-sectional analysis was performed on trainees' consultation data. Results: In total, 645 individual trainees contributed data from 84 615 consultations. Altogether, 11% of all problems managed were skin problems. Infections, dermatitis, injury and wounds were the most common presentations. Associations of consultations for skin problems (compared with all other problems) included seeking in-consultation advice, planning patient follow up and generating learning goals. Conclusions: These findings suggest GP trainees find skin problems challenging and may indicate a need for more and better targeted undergraduate and GP trainee education."
