 abstract = {Aims: The aim of the current study is to examine 10 year trends in mortality and readmission following heart failure (HF) hospitalization in metropolitan and regional Australian settings. Methods and results: We identified all index HF hospitalizations in the Hunter New England region from 2005 to 2014, using a 10 year ‘look back’ period. The primary endpoint was a composite of all-cause mortality or all-cause readmission at 1 year. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, all-cause readmission, and HF readmission at 30 days and 1 year. We used logistic regression to explore the predictors of the composite outcome of either all-cause death or readmission at 1 year. There were 12 114 patients admitted with a first episode of HF between 2005 and 2014, followed up until death or the end of 2015. The mean age was 78 ± 12 years and 49% (n = 5906) were male. A total of 4831 (40%) resided in regional areas and the remainder in metropolitan areas. One hundred sixty-eight patients (1.4%) were Aboriginal. Approximately 69% of patients had either died or been readmitted for any cause within 12 months of their index event. The 30 day and 1 year all-cause mortality rates were 13% and 32%, respectively, with no change in the trend over the study period. Age, socio-economic disadvantage, ischaemic heart disease, renal failure, and chronic lower respiratory disease were predictors of the primary endpoint. Conclusions: Heart failure hospitalizations are followed by high rates of death or readmission. There was no change in this composite endpoint over the 10 year study period.},
