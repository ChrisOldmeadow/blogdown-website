 abstract = {Limited data exist regarding co-occurring alcohol misuse and depression among general practice patients. This study examined the prevalence of depression by level of alcohol misuse, and the sociodemographic factors associated with depression and increased alcohol misuse severity. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 3559 Australian general practice patients. Patients completed their demographic details, the Patient Health Questionnaire (9-item) and the Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test (Consumption items). The prevalence of alcohol misuse and depression was 6.7%, and depression prevalence varied significantly according to level of alcohol misuse (P<0.001). Age, gender, Aboriginality and number of chronic diseases were associated with depression and higher levels of alcohol misuse. These findings may assist General Practitioners in identifying those at risk of experiencing co-morbid depression and alcohol use, and aid in effective treatment and referral.},
