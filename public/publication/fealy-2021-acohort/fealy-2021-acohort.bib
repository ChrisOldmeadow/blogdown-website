 abstract = {Problem: Studies investigating the direct and indirect relationships between psychosocial factors (i.e. attitudes, beliefs and values), health related behaviour (diet and physical activity) and gestational weight gain are increasing. To date heterogeneity of psychosocial measurement tools has limited research progress in this area, preventing measurement of effects by meta-analysis techniques. Aim: To conduct a revalidation analysis of a Weight Related Behaviours Questionnaire, originally developed by Kendall, Olson and Frangelico within the United States of America and assess its performance for use within the Australian context. Methods: A revalidation study using Exploratory Factor Analysis was undertaken to assess the factor structure and internal consistency of the six psychosocial scales of the Weight Related Behaviours Questionnaire, within the Woman and Their Children's Health (WATCH), pregnancy cohort. The questionnaire was self-completed between 18 â€“ 20 weeks gestation. Psychosocial factors included; Weight locus of control; Self-efficacy; Attitudes towards weight gain; Body image, Feelings about the motherhood role; and Career orientation. Findings: Weight locus of control, Self-efficacy and Body image, retained the same factor structure as the original analysis. The remaining psychosocial factors observed a different factor structure in terms of loadings or number of factors. Deleted items modelling suggests the questionnaire could be strengthened and shortened. Conclusion: Weight Locus of control, Self-efficacy and Body image were observed as consistent, valid and reliable psychosocial measures for use within the Australian context. Further research is needed to confirm the model and investigate the potential for combining these scales into a shorter psychosocial measurement tool.},
