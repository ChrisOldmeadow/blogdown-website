 abstract = {Introduction and Aims: This study aimed to compare current and ex-smokers' sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics, use of cessation aids and abrupt versus gradual quitting approaches. Design and Methods: A cross-sectional survey of financially disadvantaged adults attending a community service organisation was conducted in New South Wales, Australia, between February 2012 and December 2013. Sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, use of cessation aids and gradual versus abrupt quit approach were assessed. χ2 tests and logistic regression compared characteristics of current and ex-smokers. Results: Of 905 individuals who completed the survey, 639 (71%) were current smokers and 107 (12%) were ex-smokers. Ex-smokers were older [odds ratio (OR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.05], had higher odds of being female (OR = 1.67, 95% CI = 1.06, 2.65), lower odds of being financially stressed (OR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.76, 0.99), lower odds of anxiety and depression symptoms (OR = 0.91, 95% CI = 0.84, 0.98) and lower odds of having friends and family who were smokers (ORs ranged from 0.30–0.43). Ex-smokers had lower odds of using cessation aids and higher odds of reporting abrupt quitting during their last quit attempt (OR = 4.48, 95% CI = 2.66, 7.54). Conclusions: Lower levels of disadvantage, less smoking in social networks, less use of cessation aids and abrupt (vs. gradual) quitting approaches were associated with being an ex-smoker. Lower use of evidence based methods to quit by disadvantaged ex-smokers requires further exploration. [Twyman L, Bonevski B, Paul C, Bryant J, West R, Siahpush M, D'este C, Oldmeadow C, Palazzi K.
