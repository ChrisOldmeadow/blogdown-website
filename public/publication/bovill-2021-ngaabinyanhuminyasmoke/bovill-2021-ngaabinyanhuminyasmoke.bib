 abstract = {Introduction. Aboriginal pregnant women who smoke experience barriers to quitting, including challenges to social and emotional well-being, but these are infrequently quantified. Finding an appropriate measurement tool in this setting is crucial to increase knowledge for holistic smoking cessation interventions. Aims. To pilot the Growth and Empowerment Measure (GEM) with a sample of pregnant Aboriginal women who smoke. Methods. Aboriginal women participating in the step-wedge ICAN QUIT in Pregnancy pilot study completed the GEM comprised of 14-item Emotional Empowerment Scale (EES14), 12 Scenarios (12S), and K6 items at baseline, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks. Qualitative interviews with service staff were held at the end of the study to assess feasibility. Results. 15 pregnant Aboriginal women took part between November 2016 and July 2017. At 12 weeks, n=8/12 (67%) of women reported an increase in both the EES14 and 12S scores. Total 12S scores were significantly higher at 12 weeks (p=0.0186). Total K6 had a nonsignificant trend for reduction (p=0.0547). Staff reported that the length of the survey presents challenges in this setting. Conclusions. A shortened, modified GEM is recommended in this setting. We recommend the GEM to be tested in a larger study, powered to assess its associations with smoking behaviours.},
